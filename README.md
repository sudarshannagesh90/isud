# About
This is a python implementation of the variable_factor iterations for isud. Given a grid containing [1-N] in every row and column with some entries missing, we run the isud iterations to fill the entries.     

# To run
Run the script, gen_ap.py to first load the sud (via gen-a-sud), then run iterations (via rn-isud). 

# Acknowledgements
Many thanks to Prof. Metzler and Dr. Holloway for clarifying my many questions about the iterations and providing me with a Matlab implementation of this.
